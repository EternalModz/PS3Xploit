# PS3Xploit
The official website for PS3Xploit.

## Note
This repo will be updated with the latest version once the official site has been fully upgraded to support 4.90!

Since the PS3Xploit website has been super laggy and it's domains keep on changing, I've decided to host the website myself. This website is NOT mine and I do not take  credit for it. I'm simply giving users an easy way to access PS3Xploit mods without any problems. Full website credits go to the PS3Xploit team and PSX-Place. I however, will be updating the website and fixing it up. So there may be some differences on my version. And I do take credit for the changes that I make.
